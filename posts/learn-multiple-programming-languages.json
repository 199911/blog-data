To achieve this target, we have to understand and use design patterns in a proper way. The first step is to understand how to organize codes, for exmaple when to use if, when to use loop, when to define a method, etc.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2 id=\"whatdowelearnfromlearningprogramminglanguage\">What do we learn from learning programming language?</h2>\n<p>For first language</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn how to break down problems</li>\n<li>Understand what you don't know and find out resource to help you easily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For second language</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to compare similarity and difference with the first language</li>\n<li>Deeper understand on the first language you learn<ul>\n<li>What the language is designed in that way</li>\n<li>How features make the language good or bad</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"differentprograminglanguagetrytopushyoutosolveproblemsinacertainway\">Different programing language try to push you to solve problems in a certain way.</h1>\n<p>For example, Rudy encourage us to orgnaize code as objects and javascript encourage us to write code in a functional style.</p>\n<p>We can consider language is a framework.
