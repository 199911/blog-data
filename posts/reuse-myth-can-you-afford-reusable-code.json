It explain the idea of the slide in a detail way. Quite good. For the macro answer of reusability, it looks not very practical for a developer.</p>\n<p>It mentions a book named \"Mythical Man Month\", it seems a good book.</p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://allankelly.blogspot.hk/2010/10/reuse-myth-can-you-afford-reusable-code.html\">Reuse Myth - can you afford reusable code?</a>.</p>","date":"2016-05-02T15:53:58.000Z","filePath":"/Users/sunday/workspace/coding-sunday/source/_posts/review/reuse-myth-can-you-afford-reusable-code.md","slug":"reuse-myth-can-you-afford-reusable-code"}}
