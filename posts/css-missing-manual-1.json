But using some well known technique help other understand your code and help us avoid bugs. Here are some tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop using <code>&lt;font&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>Don't use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> for layout.</li>\n<li>Don't use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> for spacing, use margin or padding.</li>\n<li>Don't overuse <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code></li>\n<li>Don't forget Doctype!</li>\n<li>No doctype will fallback to old browser mode, which may make the page render in a strange way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"somemistakesinthebook\">Some mistakes in the book</h3>\n<p>The book mention that there will be no CSS4, because CSS3 will only updating CSS3 modules.

One way to avoid it is to develop with internal CSS, move it to external later</p>\n<p>Some developer use external script for general style and internal script for page customization. Make sure internal script is load after the external one if you do this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"avoididselector\">Avoid ID selector</h3>\n<p>ID selectors have the highest specificity, stop using it in CSS to avoid specificity wars.</p>","filePath":"/Users/sunday/workspace/coding-sunday/source/_posts/review/CSS-missing-manual-1.md","slug":"css-missing-manual-1"}
